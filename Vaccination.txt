Where can I get the vaccine from
Vaccines are available from Government and Private Health Facilities as notified, known as COVID Vaccination Centres (CVCs).

How do I pre-register myself online for an appointment for vaccination
Online registration and appointment can be done through Co-WIN portal You will have to give some basic information about yourself and details of your photo identification card to get yourself registered online From one mobile phone number, one can register 4 people, however, each person will need their own photo identification document.

Spot registration of the vaccine
Those who cannot get themselves registered online can contact their local Government health workers, who will help the beneficiaries to the Government CVC for on the spot registration, appointment, verification and vaccination on the same day. 

Can a person get the COVID-19 vaccine without registration with Health Department
No, the registration of beneficiary is mandatory for vaccination for COVID-19 vaccine Once registered, notification and information about the vaccine session date and time will be shared with the beneficiary.

Photo
The Photo ID produced at the time of registration must be produced and verified at the time of vaccination.

If a person is not able to produce Photo ID at the session site, whether s/he be vaccinated or not
Photo ID is a must for both registration and verification of beneficiary at session site to ensure that the intended person is vaccinated.

Will vaccinated beneficiaries receive information on the status of their vaccination after completion
Yes. On getting due dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the beneficiary will receive SMS on their registered mobile number. After all doses of vaccine are administered, a QR code based certificate will also be sent to the registered mobile number of the beneficiary.

Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19
Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections.COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.

treatments available for COVID-19
the FDA approved the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.

What is WHO's recommendation for how much time there should be between the two doses
Most of the vaccines that are being developed need at least two doses, but there are some single dose vaccine candidates as well.Most of the two those vaccines currently are being given between three to four weeks between the first and the second dose.

what if I can't make it to my second dose
It's important to get the second dose if the vaccine is a two those schedule. It doesn't matter if it's early by a few days or late by a few days or even a couple of weeks as second dose is the one that really gives a boost to the immune system

can these two doses be from two different manufacturers
At the present time, there isn't enough data for us to recommend this type of interchangeable two dose schedules.

How have we ensured that there are no long-term effects of these vaccines.
WHO has a pharmacovigilance system that we work both with regulators and manufacturers, but also with countries that have set up safety monitoring systems so that we are constantly reviewing the adverse events that are being reported into the system.

Which vaccine is better between Covisheild and Covaxin
There is no head-to-head comparison done between the two vaccines being used in India so one cannot choose one over the other. Both would work fine in preventing the infection as well as prevent a person from going into severe state of the disease. As a long-term effect, it would be preventing death for elderly people or those who have comorbidities.

Does vaccination protect me against newer strains / mutated virus of SARS-CoV 2
The body responds to vaccination by making more than one type of antibodies to virus parts including spike protein. Therefore, all vaccines are expected to provide reasonable amount of protection against the mutated virus also. Based on the available data the mutations as reported are unlikely to make the vaccine ineffective.

Can we stop taking precautions after being vaccinated
Vaccination protects you from getting seriously ill and dying from COVID-19. For the first fourteen days after getting a vaccination, you do not have significant levels of protection, then it increases gradually.

Do the vaccines protect against variants
More studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current COVID vaccines against the variants. A growing body of data suggests that most vaccines stimulate enough immunity to retain substantial efficacy against most variants, especially for severe disease, hospitalization, and death. The impact of the variants on efficacy against mild disease and against infection without disease is more impacted than for the more severe outcomes.

How long I will remain protected after vaccination
Longevity of the immune response in vaccinated individuals is yet to be determined Hence, continuing the use of masks, handwashing, physical distancing and other COVID-19 appropriate behaviours is strongly recommended.

Is it important for me to receive the same vaccine during second dose
As the vaccines available are not interchangeable, it is important to receive the second dose of same vaccine as the first one The Co-WIN portal is also going to help to ensure that everyone receives the same vaccine.

Why vaccination is not provided to children who are usual target
COVID-19 affects all age groups however, morbidity & mortality is several times higher in adults particularly in those above the age of 50 years Children have either asymptomatic or mild infection The general practice is to first evaluate any new vaccine in older population and then age reduction is done to assess the safety and effectiveness in paediatric population The currently available vaccines have not been evaluated in children so far There are some clinical trials now underway to test the effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines in children.

WHY ARE FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE STILL CATCHING COVID-19
No vaccine is perfect, so “breakthrough infections”, where people get sick with an infection even after vaccination, are to be expected with any disease But just how common are they when it comes to COVID-19, and what should you expect if you test positive for SARS-CoV-2 after being fully vaccinated.
